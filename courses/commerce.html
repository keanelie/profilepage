                            Personally, I found COMM1100 not that too bad of a course as I did do a little bit of economics during highschool. Having Joshua Wang as a tutor was definately a pro; involving students and having a clear measurement in order to gauge participation.

                            If you put enough effort it is a very easy HD subject. I managed to get this mark whilst heavily underperfoming in the first assesment (Literally was going to get 0, but I messaged the course and sorted things out).

                            Personal experience doing this course was rather poor. Thoughout the term due dates for assignments were extended 1 or 2 times due to how ambiguous and poorly written they were. This was really annoying. At times I felt disadvantaged not doing COMM1110 which was not a prerequisite given that I had done MATH1131/1141. They did understand this, giving a couple videos, however, I don't understand how 1-2 hours of youtube videos can suffice for an entire course; having the lecturer assume that each student is able to understand 1110 content. Regardless, I still learnt somethings which were interesting.
